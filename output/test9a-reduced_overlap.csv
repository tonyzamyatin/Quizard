What are the hallmarks of cancer that are common across many types?; The hallmarks of cancer include uncontrolled cell growth and division, evasion of apoptosis, and evasion of the immune system.
How do mutations in the LDLR or APOB genes contribute to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)?; Mutations in these genes act dominantly through haploinsufficiency, leading to defects in the recognition and uptake of cholesterol, resulting in elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood vessels.
How do the mutations in genes associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) affect heart function?; In HCM, the mutations lead to thickening of the heart muscle, while in DCM, the mutations cause the heart to become enlarged and weakened.

Genetic Mapping (Linkage Mapping); The process of assigning genes to a particular chromosome and determining their arrangement within the chromosome through the study of different alleles and meiotic recombination.
Chromosomal Mapping; The process of locating genes or DNA sequences on chromosomes using techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or deletion mapping.
Physical Mapping; The prediction and localization of genes on chromosomes through DNA sequencing.
Recombination; The exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
Linkage; The tendency of genes located close together on a chromosome to be inherited together.
Recombination Frequency; The frequency at which recombination occurs between two genes on a chromosome, measured in centi-Morgans (cM).
What is the difference between genetic mapping and physical mapping?; Genetic mapping involves the study of different alleles and meiotic recombination to assign genes to specific chromosomes, while physical mapping uses DNA sequencing to predict and locate genes on chromosomes.
How is recombination related to incomplete linkage and the position of genes on a chromosome?; Incomplete linkage occurs when genes on the same chromosome are separated by recombination during meiosis. The closer together two genes are on a chromosome, the less likely recombination is to occur between them.
How is recombination frequency measured and what does it indicate?; Recombination frequency is measured in centi-Morgans (cM) and represents the percentage of recombination that occurs between two gene markers. A higher recombination frequency indicates that the genes are further apart on the chromosome.
Why is it important to confirm bioinformatic gene predictions with empirical methods?; Bioinformatic gene predictions are based on algorithms and sequence analysis, but they may not always accurately predict the presence of a gene. Empirical methods such as cDNA sequencing and knockout experiments provide definitive evidence of a gene's presence and function.
Why might the recombination frequencies between three genes not match the sum of the recombination frequencies between pairs of genes?; The uneven distribution of meiotic exchanges (crossovers) along chromosomes can result in inconsistent recombination frequencies. Multiple crossovers between genes can occur, leading to discrepancies between the observed recombination frequencies and the sum of individual pairings.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of sexual reproduction?; Sexual reproduction allows for diploidy, genetic recombination, and the potential for heterosis (advantage of individuals with different alleles). However, it can be inefficient due to the twofold cost of males and the need for partners to locate each other for reproduction.
Monogenic Systems; Systems that work according to the backcrossing scheme, where the cross of a heterozygous individual with a recessive homozygous individual produces 50% heterozygous progeny.
Heterogametic; The sex with different sex chromosomes.
Homogametic; The sex with uniform sex chromosomes.
Polygenic Sex Determination; When there are many sex-determining genes, which may even be located on different chromosomes.
Segmentation Genes; Genes that control the division of the embryo into segments.
Homeotic Genes; Genes that determine the structures that will be formed in each body segment of adult animals.
Whorl; A segment or layer of a flower.
What is the role of the Y-chromosome in sex determination in humans?; The Y-chromosome, specifically the SRY region, is the dominant factor for sex determination. It determines male development by initiating the formation of testes in the embryo.
How does X-chromosomal dosage compensation work in females?; In females, one of the two X chromosomes becomes inactivated to ensure that females do not express twice as many X-chromosomal genes as males. This process is known as X-inactivation.
How do homeotic genes determine the structures formed in each body segment of adult animals?; Homeotic genes are activated after the expression of segmentation genes and control the development of specific structures in each body segment. Mutations in these genes can result in the formation of extremities in the wrong segments.
Why do multicellular organisms show a segmental body plan?; Multicellular organisms have evolved a segmental body plan through the composition of identical subunits according to the molecular design principle, followed by the specialization of these segments. This allows for efficient development and specialization of different body parts.
How do mutations in homeotic genes lead to developmental abnormalities?; Mutations in homeotic genes can disrupt the normal development of body segments, causing the formation of structures in the wrong segments. This can result in abnormalities such as legs instead of antennas or wings instead of balancers in organisms like Drosophila.
Homeotic Genes; Genes that determine the identity and positioning of organs within a flower.
Quantitative Genetics; The study of heritable components of continuously varying traits.

Microevolution; The change in allele and genotype frequencies within a population over generations.
What is the difference between homeotic genes in animals and organ identity genes in plants?; Homeotic genes in animals and organ identity genes in plants are analogous systems that evolved independently in their respective kingdoms. They are not homologous.
What is the multi-gene hypothesis of quantitative traits?; The multi-gene hypothesis states that the cumulative effects of multiple genes cause the continuity of quantitative traits.
How are QTLs mapped in plants and humans?; In plants, QTLs can be mapped through the crossing of true-breeding lineages and screening F2 individuals for correlations with linked DNA marker sequences. In humans, GWAS compare the genomes of large cohorts to identify genes contributing to quantitative traits.
How is heritability estimated for a trait?; Heritability is estimated by scoring a large number of individuals of a population under constant environmental conditions and calculating the ratio of genotypic variance to phenotypic variance.
What causes microevolution?; Microevolution can be caused by natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, migration, and non-random mating.
How might the understanding of heritability be important in clinical genetics and breeding programs for animals and plants?; Knowledge of heritability allows for the identification of traits that are predominantly influenced by genetic factors, aiding in the selection and breeding of desirable traits.
What are the potential limitations or challenges in conducting GWAS studies in humans?; GWAS studies rely on large cohorts of patients and controls with accurate genomic data, which may be difficult to collect and analyze. Additionally, environmental and lifestyle factors can complicate the interpretation of genetic associations with quantitative traits.
How does microevolution contribute to the overall diversity of species?; Microevolutionary changes in allele and genotype frequencies over generations can lead to the origin of new species and higher taxonomic entities through macroevolution. This diversity contributes to the richness of life on Earth.
Genetic Drift; Random chance causing the loss or increase of a rare allele in a population.
Bottleneck Effect; When a population goes through a drastic reduction in size, causing a loss of genetic diversity.
Founder Effect; When a small group of individuals establish a new population, leading to a change in allele frequencies.
Non-Random Mating; When mating preferences or behaviors lead to a deviation from random mating in a population.
Microevolution; Small-scale evolutionary changes within a population.
What is the difference between selection and drift in terms of their effects on allele frequencies?; Selection acts on specific traits, favoring certain alleles, while drift is based on random chance and can lead to the loss or increase of rare alleles.
How does non-random mating affect allele frequencies in a population?; Non-random mating, such as mating preference or selective mating, can alter the distribution of alleles among individuals and decrease the proportion of heterozygotes.
Why does selection work better in small, isolated populations?; Small, isolated populations have a higher chance of carrying rare alleles in the homozygous condition, making them more susceptible to selection pressures.
Why might genetic drift be more efficient in small populations?; In small populations, the effects of random chance are more pronounced due to a smaller gene pool, leading to a greater impact on allele frequencies.
What are the potential consequences of non-random mating, such as female partner choice, for a population?; While female partner choice may be adaptive for individual females, it can lead to a reduction in population-wide genetic diversity if females consistently choose mates with certain traits, potentially limiting the future adaptability of the population.
