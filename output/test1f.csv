What is posttranscriptional regulation?;Posttranscriptional regulation refers to the regulation of gene expression that occurs after transcription, through interactions with specific molecules that can modify RNA transcripts.
What are the two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation in bacteria?;The two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation in bacteria are attenuation, which involves the reduction of gene expression levels through an attenuator sequence, and riboswitches, which are conformational changes in the secondary structure of the mRNA that can be controlled by specific ligand-aptamer interactions.
What is attenuation?;Attenuation is a feature of operons responsible for amino acid synthesis in bacteria, such as the trp operon. It involves the reduction of transcription through an attenuator sequence.
What are riboswitches?;Riboswitches are conformational changes in the secondary structure of the mRNA that can be controlled by specific ligands binding to an aptamer region. They can regulate transcription or translation in bacteria.
What is the role of gene regulation in eukaryotes?;In eukaryotes, gene regulation establishes cellular heterogeneity and diversity, allowing different cells to express different sets of genes and perform specialized functions.
What are some key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression?;Some key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression include the larger genome size and complexity in eukaryotes, the presence of histones and chromatin structure in eukaryotes, the spatial separation of transcription and translation in eukaryotes, and the different methods of post-transcriptional processing in eukaryotes.
What are nucleosomes and how do they affect gene expression?;Nucleosomes are composed of DNA wrapped around histone proteins and are involved in the packaging of DNA into chromatin. Changes in the nucleosome composition can alter the accessibility of DNA, making it more or less available for transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, and thus influencing gene expression.
What is chromatin remodeling?;Chromatin remodeling involves the repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA, which can alter the accessibility of specific DNA regions to transcription factors and RNA polymerase II.
What are histone modifications and how do they impact gene expression?;Histone modifications refer to the covalent addition of functional groups to histone proteins, such as acetyl, methyl, or phosphate groups. These modifications can affect the interaction between histones and DNA, influencing the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, and therefore impacting gene expression.
What is the role of enhancers in gene expression regulation?;Enhancers are short genomic elements that can be located far away from the gene they regulate. They interact with promoters through looping of the DNA, and their binding of specific proteins helps to stabilize the transcription initiation complex, leading to enhanced gene expression.
