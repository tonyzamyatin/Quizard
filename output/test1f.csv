What are the two principal manners of posttranscriptional regulation in bacteria?;Attenuation and riboswitches.
What is attenuation?;Attenuation is the reduction of transcription through an attenuator sequence and is a feature of operons responsible for amino acid synthesis.
What is a riboswitch?;A riboswitch is a conformation change in the secondary structure of the 5â€™ UTR or mRNA that occurs upon ligand binding and can modulate transcription or translation.
What is the purpose of gene regulation in eukaryotes?;Gene regulation in eukaryotes establishes cellular heterogeneity and diversity, allowing different cells to express different sets of genes.
What are some key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression in terms of regulation?;Prokaryotes have simultaneous transcription and translation, while eukaryotes have spatial separation between transcription and translation. Eukaryotes also have larger genome size and complexity, chromatin remodeling, splicing and RNA processing, and regulation of RNA export and stability.
What are nucleosomes and how do they impact transcription?;Nucleosomes are structures formed by DNA wrapped around histone proteins. Changes in nucleosome composition can alter the accessibility of DNA, allowing for transcription activation or repression.
What is chromatin remodeling?;Chromatin remodeling involves repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA, which can make chromosomal regions more accessible to transcription regulatory proteins and activate transcription.
What are histone modifications and how do they influence gene expression?;Histone modifications are covalent modifications of histone proteins, such as acetylation and methylation. These modifications can influence the accessibility of DNA, allowing for gene activation or repression.
What is DNA methylation and what role does it play in gene regulation?;DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine of CG doublets in DNA. It is associated with transcriptional silencing and can regulate gene expression.
What are cis-acting sequences and what are their functions?;Cis-acting sequences are nucleotide sequences on the same chromosome as the gene they regulate. They include promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, and are required for accurate transcription initiation and regulation of gene expression.
