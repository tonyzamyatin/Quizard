What are some examples of posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms?;Modification of RNA transcripts, such as changes in secondary structure, covalent modifications, or changes in RNA stability.
What are the two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation in bacteria through modifying the secondary structure of RNA?;Attenuation and riboswitches.
What is attenuation?;Attenuation is a reduction of transcription through an attenuator sequence, often found in operons responsible for amino acid synthesis.
What are riboswitches?;Riboswitches are conformation changes in the secondary structure of the 5' UTR or mRNA that can modulate transcription or translation by interacting with specific ligands.
What is the purpose of gene regulation in eukaryotes?;Gene regulation in eukaryotes establishes cellular heterogeneity and diversity and defines cell identity by controlling which genes are expressed and at what levels.
What are some key differences in gene expression regulation between prokaryotes and eukaryotes?;Eukaryotes have a larger and more complex genome, DNA is organized into chromatin with histones, transcription and translation are spatially separated, eukaryotic transcripts undergo processing and transport before translation, and eukaryotes use less polycistronic transcripts.
What are some levels of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes?;Chromatin remodeling and histone modifications, splicing and RNA processing, regulation of RNA export, mRNA stability/degradation, and control of translation rates.
How do changes in nucleosome composition affect gene expression?;Changes in nucleosome composition can alter the accessibility of DNA, either repressing or activating transcription by gating the accessibility of the promoter sequence.
What are chromatin remodeling and histone modifications?;Chromatin remodeling involves repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA to make chromosome regions more accessible to transcription factors and RNA Pol II. Histone modifications involve covalent bonding of functional groups to histone proteins, such as acetylation or methylation, which can influence chromatin activity and accessibility.
What is DNA methylation and how does it affect gene expression?;DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to cytosine in CpG dinucleotides. Methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing and can regulate gene expression by blocking the binding of transcription factors to regulatory regions.
