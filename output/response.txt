What is posttranscriptional regulation?;Posttranscriptional regulation is the regulation of gene expression that occurs after transcription, through interactions with specific molecules that can change the secondary structure of RNA, establish covalent modifications, or alter RNA stability.
What are the two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation in bacteria by modifying the secondary structure of RNA?;The two principal manners are attenuation, which involves the reduction of gene expression levels through an attenuator sequence, and riboswitches, which are conformation changes in the secondary structure of the 5' UTR or mRNA that can modulate transcription or translation.
What is attenuation?;Attenuation is a feature of operons responsible for amino acid synthesis, such as the trp operon in bacteria, where transcription is reduced through an attenuator sequence.
What are riboswitches?;Riboswitches are conformation changes in the secondary structure of the 5' UTR or mRNA that can be recognized by ligands, leading to modulation of transcription or translation.
What is the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene regulation?;Some key differences include the larger genome size and complexity in eukaryotes, the formation of chromatin due to the combination of DNA with histones, the spatial separation of transcription and translation in eukaryotes, and additional levels of regulation such as chromatin remodeling and RNA processing in eukaryotes.
What is chromatin remodeling?;Chromatin remodeling involves the repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA, which requires energy in the form of ATP. It can make certain chromosome regions accessible to transcription regulatory proteins and RNA Pol II.
What are histone modifications?;Histone modifications refer to the covalent bonding of functional groups onto the N-terminal tails of histone proteins. They can include acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, among others, and can influence the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and RNA Pol II.
What is DNA methylation?;DNA methylation occurs most often on the cytosine of CG doublets in DNA, also known as CpG methylation. It is associated with transcriptional silencing and can affect gene expression patterns.
What are proximal-promoter elements?;Proximal-promoter elements are nucleotide sequences located upstream of the TATA and BRE motifs in promoters. They enhance the levels of basal transcription and can include elements such as CAAT boxes and GC boxes.
What are enhancers?;Enhancers are short genomic elements located near or within genes, some distance away from the promoter. They regulate transcription by interacting with specific proteins and stabilizing an active transcription initiation complex through looping.
