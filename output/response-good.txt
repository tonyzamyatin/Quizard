What is posttranscriptional regulation?;Posttranscriptional regulation refers to the regulation of gene expression that occurs after transcription, through interactions with specific molecules that can change the secondary structure of RNA, modify RNA molecules, or affect RNA stability.
What are the two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation in bacteria?;The two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation in bacteria are attenuation and riboswitches.
What is attenuation?;Attenuation is a reduction of transcription through an attenuator sequence and is a feature of operons responsible for amino acid synthesis.
What are riboswitches?;Riboswitches are conformational changes in the secondary structure of the 5' UTR or mRNA that occur in response to ligand-aptamer interactions, leading to modulation of transcription or translation.
What is the role of eukaryotic gene regulation?;Eukaryotic gene regulation establishes cellular heterogeneity and diversity by controlling which genes are expressed and at what levels, defining the cell identity.
What are some key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression?;Some key differences include the larger genome size and complexity in eukaryotes, the packaging of DNA with histones to form chromatin, the spatial separation of transcription and translation in eukaryotes, and the presence of additional levels of regulation in eukaryotes such as splicing and mRNA processing.
What is chromatin remodeling?;Chromatin remodeling involves repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA, allowing for accessibility of transcriptional regulatory proteins and RNA Pol II to the promoter sequence.
What are histone modifications?;Histone modifications refer to covalent bonding of functional groups onto histone proteins, such as acetyl, methyl, and phosphate groups, which can affect the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and RNA Pol II.
What is DNA methylation?;DNA methylation refers to the addition of methyl groups to cytosine residues in DNA, specifically in CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing.
What are promoters and enhancers?;Promoters are nucleotide sequences that serve as recognition sites for the transcription machinery and are critical for transcription initiation. Enhancers are short genomic elements that can regulate transcription of genes, often located at a distance from the gene itself.
