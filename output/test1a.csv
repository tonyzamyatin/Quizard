What is the purpose of the graphic pipeline?;The graphic pipeline transforms information into an image by describing objects and the scene, setting the viewing direction, projecting objects, and converting the result into raster points.
What are the different names for the graphic pipeline?;The graphic pipeline is also known as the viewing pipeline, transformations pipeline, or rendering pipeline.
How can objects be created in the graphic pipeline?;Objects can be created through modeling or scanning.
What do the terms "vertex shader" and "fragment shader" refer to?;The terms "vertex shader" and "fragment shader" are used for programmable parts of graphics cards.
How are polygon lists used to represent three-dimensional objects?;Polygon lists describe the surface of an object using polygons, often triangles.
What are B-Reps in the context of polygon lists?;B-Reps refer to the boundary representation of a set of polygons that describe the surface of an object.
What are the advantages of using CSG to construct objects?;CSG allows for precise representations, low memory usage, and simple transformations.
What is the process of ray-casting for CSG objects?;Ray-casting involves calculating the color of each pixel by casting a ray through the scene and finding the intersection with CSG objects.
What are quad trees and octrees used for?;Quad trees and octrees are data structures used to represent two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects, respectively.
What is a szenegraph?;A scene graph is an object-oriented data structure that hierarchically describes the logical and/or spatial arrangement of elements in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional scene.
