regulation of gene expression;directs the production of RNA transcripts in a way that the right amount of RNA is produced at the right time in the right cells
positive regulation of transcription;activation of transcription induced upon a specific signal
negative regulation of transcription;inactivation of transcription once sufficient levels protein have been produced
regulation of promoter activity;regulation of the activity of the transcription machinery and chromatin accessibility/epigenetic mechanisms
posttranscriptional regulation;modification of RNA transcripts that can modulate translation efficiency or RNA stability
transcription and translation in prokaryotes;co-regulated, unlike in eukaryotes where they are separated
operons in prokaryotes;contain a single promoter and operator sequence and the group of genes they control
vertex shader;programmable part of a graphics card used for shading vertices of objects
fragment shader;programmable part of a graphics card used for shading fragments of objects
quadtree;a data structure used to represent two-dimensional structures
octree;an extension of quadtree to represent three-dimensional structures
scenegraph;a hierarchical data structure used to describe the logical and/or spatial arrangement of elements in a scene
