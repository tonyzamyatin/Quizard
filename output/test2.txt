What is posttranscriptional regulation?;Posttranscriptional regulation refers to the regulation of gene expression that occurs after transcription, through interaction with specific molecules that can change RNA secondary structure, establish covalent modifications, or affect RNA stability.
What are the two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation by modifying the secondary structure of RNA in bacteria?;The two principal manners are attenuation and riboswitches.
What is attenuation?;Attenuation is a mechanism of reducing gene expression levels through an attenuator sequence, commonly found in operons responsible for amino acid synthesis.
What are riboswitches?;Riboswitches are RNA secondary structures that undergo a conformational change upon ligand binding, thus modulating transcription or translation.
What is the rule of thumb in eukaryotic gene regulation?;The rule of thumb is that approximately half of the available genes in most cells are expressed, and the combination of expressed genes and their relative expression levels define cell identity.
What are some key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression?;Some key differences include the larger genome size and complexity in eukaryotes, the presence of histones and chromatin structure in eukaryotes, the spatial separation of transcription and translation in eukaryotes, and the extensive processing and transport of transcripts in eukaryotes.
What is chromatin remodelling?;Chromatin remodelling involves repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA, which can make specific regions accessible to transcription factors and RNA polymerase II.
What are histone modifications?;Histone modifications are covalent modifications, such as acetylation or methylation, of histone proteins. These modifications can affect chromatin activity and accessibility, influencing gene expression levels.
What is DNA methylation?;DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to cytosine residues in DNA, often occurring in CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing.
What are enhancers, silencers, and insulators?;Enhancers are short genomic elements that regulate the transcription of regulatory elements. Silencers repress transcription initiation, and insulators block or regulate enhancer-promoter interactions.
