        "content": "What is posttranscriptional regulation?;Posttranscriptional regulation refers to the regulation of gene expression that occurs after transcription, through interactions of specific molecules with specific regions on the RNA transcript.\nWhat are the two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation in bacteria through modifying the secondary structure of RNA?;The two principal manners are attenuation and riboswitches.\nWhat is attenuation in bacteria?;Attenuation is the reduction of transcription through an attenuator sequence, and it is a feature of operons responsible for amino acid synthesis.\nWhat are riboswitches in bacteria?;Riboswitches are conformational changes in the secondary structure of the 5' UTR or mRNA that occur upon ligand binding, leading to modulation of transcription or translation.\nWhat are the key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression?;Some key differences include the larger genome size and complexity in eukaryotes, the presence of chromatin and histones in eukaryotes, the spatial separation of transcription and translation in eukaryotes, and the processing of transcripts, such as splicing and RNA processing, in eukaryotes.\nWhat is chromatin remodeling in eukaryotes?;Chromatin remodeling refers to the repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA in order to make chromosome regions accessible to transcription regulatory proteins and RNA Pol II.\nWhat are histone modifications and how do they affect gene expression?;Histone modifications are covalent bonding of functional groups onto the N-terminal tails of histone proteins. They can affect gene expression by altering the affinity of histones to DNA, making DNA more accessible to transcription factors and RNA Pol II.\nWhat is DNA methylation and how does it affect gene expression?;DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine of CG doublets in DNA. It is associated with transcriptional silencing. DNA methylation at CpG islands, which are often found in promoters, can affect gene expression.\nWhat are promoters and what is their role in transcription initiation?;Promoters are nucleotide sequences that serve as recognition sites for the transcription machinery. They are critical for transcription initiation and determine the accurate initiation of transcription.\nWhat are enhancers, silencers, and insulators in gene regulation?;Enhancers are short genomic elements that regulate the transcription of regulatory elements and are important for achieving maximum levels of transcription and cell type-specific gene expression. Silencers repress the level of transcription initiation. Insulators are found between an enhancer and a promoter for a non-target gene and can block or allow specific enhancer-promoter interactions.\nWhat are proximal-promoter elements and what role do they play in transcription?;Proximal-promoter elements are located upstream of TATA and BRE motifs in promoters and enhance levels of basal transcription. Examples include CAAT and GC boxes. Mutations in these sequences can have a major impact on transcription levels."

        "content": "What is posttranscriptional regulation?;Posttranscriptional regulation refers to the regulation of gene expression that occurs after transcription, such as changes in RNA structure, covalent modifications, or RNA stability, which can affect transcription efficiency.\nWhat are the two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation in bacteria?;The two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation in bacteria are attenuation and riboswitches. Attenuation is the reduction of transcription through an attenuator sequence, while riboswitches involve a conformation change in the secondary structure of the RNA that is regulated by specific ligand-aptamer interactions.\nWhat is the purpose of chromatin remodeling in gene expression regulation?;Chromatin remodeling involves repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA and allows transcription regulatory proteins, transcription activators, and RNA Pol II to access the promoter sequence, thereby regulating gene expression.\nWhat are histone modifications and how do they influence gene expression?;Histone modifications are covalent bonding of functional groups onto histone proteins. The most common modifications include acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation. These modifications can alter the accessibility of DNA and influence the binding of histones to DNA, thereby affecting transcription activation or repression.\nWhat is DNA methylation and how does it affect gene expression?;DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine of CG doublets in DNA. This methylation, particularly at CpG islands, is associated with transcriptional silencing and can regulate gene expression by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors to DNA.\nWhat are enhancers and how do they regulate gene expression?;Enhancers are short genomic elements located near or within a gene that regulate transcription. They bind specific transcription factors and mediator proteins, and through looping interactions, bring enhancers and promoters into contact, resulting in the activation of transcription initiation.\nWhat are proximal-promoter elements and what role do they play in gene expression?;Proximal-promoter elements are located upstream of the TATA and BRE motifs in promoters. They enhance levels of basal transcription and include sequence motifs such as CAAT and GC boxes. Mutations in these elements can significantly impact transcription levels.\nWhat is the relationship between transcription initiation and core promoters in eukaryotes?;Core promoters are nucleotide sequences that serve as recognition sites for the transcription machinery. They determine the accurate initiation of transcription and are located immediately upstream of the genes they promote.\nWhat is the role of silencers in gene expression regulation?;Silencers are cis-acting transcription regulatory elements that repress the level of transcription initiation. They can be found in close proximity to a gene and inhibit its transcription by interacting with transcription factors and other regulatory proteins.\nHow do enhancers and promoters interact in eukaryotes to regulate gene expression?;Enhancers and promoters can interact through looping mechanisms, bringing them into physical proximity. This allows for the stabilization of an active transcription initiation complex and facilitates the efficient transcription of genes."
