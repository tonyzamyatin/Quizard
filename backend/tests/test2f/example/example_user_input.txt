Gene regulation can occur after transcription by interaction of specific molecules with specific
regions on the transcript. This can e.g., change the secondary structure of the RNA, establish covalent
modifications of RNA, or change the stability of the RNA molecule. This can increase or decrease the
efficiency of transcription. In bacteria, 2 principal manners of controlling transcription/translation by
modifying the secondary structure of RNA are known. These are attenuation (reduction of gene
expression levels) and riboswitches. Attenuation is the reduction of transcription through an
attenuator sequence. It is a feature of operons responsible for amino acid synthesis (e.g., trp
operon). A riboswitch is a conformation change in the secondary structure of the 5â€™ UTR or mRNA.
After transcription secondary structures form, that can be recognized by ligands. This leads to
modulation of transcription or translation. In e.g., B. subtilis 5% of genes are controlled by
riboswitches.
