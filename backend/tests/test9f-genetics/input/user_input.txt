DEFINITIONS
Genome - all genetic information present in a single cell of an organism
Transcriptome - is the set of all RNA transcripts, including coding and noncoding, in an individual or a population of cells.
Proteome - entire set of proteins that is expressed by a genome, cell, tissue, or organism at a certain time.
Homologous genes - Genes that are evolutionarily related; they share the same evolutionary origin
Orthologs - Homologous genes found in different species. They are thought to have descended from a common ancestor but have
largely equivalent molecular functions
Paralogs - Homologous genes in same species that have the same evolutionary origin but have distinct molecular functions
Genetic linkage = Linked genes (on one and the same chromosome) are not randomly segregated in gametesr: Linkage group
Morgan-Units = 1 Centi-Morgan (cM) corresponds to one percent recombination between two marker genes (50 cM corresponds to
50% recombination = free combination)
Heterosis: Advantage of individuals (often hybrids) that possess different alleles of many genes.
Quantitative traits display continuous variation
Polygenic = Varying phenotypes result from input of many genes
Polygenes = groups of genes co-regulating quantitative traits
Multifactorial or complex traits = Result of both gene action and environmental influences
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) = genetic regions that are associated with variation in a complex trait
Gene targeting = To manipulate specific allele, locus, or base sequence to learn its function
Gene knockout = To disrupt or eliminate specific genes to study the resulting phenotype (effect of a certain genetic setup or
genotype)
Gene knockin = To modify an endogenous locus. e.g., express a fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and your gene of interest
Transgenic animals = Express or overexpress particular gene of interest (transgene)
BASIC INFORMATION
Contains: Lecture 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13
Example for reverse Transcription: Telomers - use an RNA template to synthesize DNA at the ends of chromosomes.
Cohesion between Sister Chromatids
Mediated by protein complex = cohesion → 4 subunits: SMC1 and SMC3 & Rad21 and SA1/2
The cohesin ring is loaded onto the chromatin by the Scc2/4 complex during the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
Holds the sisters together until the onset of anaphase.
Cleavage of Cohesin in Anaphase by Separase
Prophase → Cohensin on the arms is cleaved
(Pro)metaphase → Cohesin at the centromeres is protected by Shugoshin (sgo1) until anaphase
Anaphase → All cohesin is cleaved by separase
Mitosis
Used for:
Growth and development Tissue repair and regeneration Asexual reproduction
Output: two cells with diploid character
The Stages of Mitosis
Prophase:
• Centrioles divide and migrate to the polar positions
• The Nuclear Envelope breaks down (NEBD)
• Chromosomes compact and become visible
Prometaphase:
• Microtubules attach to Centromeres and move the chromosomes towards the cell equator
➔ Push towards the equator by MT-associated motor proteins
Metaphase:
• The metaphase plate is formed
• Sister Chromatids are bioriented
Anaphase:
• Connection between the sister chromatids is released
• Pulling of the sisters towards the opposite poles
➔ Pull by MT depolymerization at kinetochores & by Pushing apart the poles
Telophase:
• Chromatids have arrived at the poles
• Formation of a new nuclear envelope
• Decondensation of the Chromosomes
Meiosis
Meiosis has two rounds of cell division, each consisting of four stages: Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase I, Telophase I,
and Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, and Telophase II. It involves the exchange of genetic material between
homologous chromosomes and the separation of the sister chromatids.
Used for:
Sexual reproduction Genetic diversity Rejuvenation
Output: cells with haploid character (sperm & egg)
meiotic crossing over
(1) Homologous chromosomes pair up (Prophase I) and form a bivalent structure called a tetrad.
(2) DNA strands break (Spo11) at corresponding points, creating small gaps.
(3) Strand exchange forms new combinations of genetic material.
(4) The broken DNA strands are then rejoined.
(5) Chiasmata formation connects physically the homologous chromosomes and helps to hold them together during
the rest of meiosis.
(6) Segregation and movement to opposite poles of the cell (Anaphase I)
The Obligatory Crossover in the Pseudoautosomal Region (PAR) of Sex Chromosomes
Despite their heteromorphism and low homology, X and Y must pair and perform crossing over in ♂ meiosis.
The pseudoautosomal region (PAR) is not home to sex-relevant genes → Obligatory Crossover which is necessary for
proper segregation of the sex chromosomes.
Cell Cycle Checkpoints
The Entry into the S-Phase is triggered by the Cyclein dependent kinases* (CDKs) whose activity is dependent on cyclins
activate or inactivate proteins. The transition into S-phase is irreversible.
G1/S Checkpoint (START) - Cell monitors size, availability of nutrients, cell density, signals from neighboring cells and
integrity of DNA (when CDK high enough, then Replication is triggered)
G2/M Checkpoint = DNA Damage Checkpoint: Cell monitors completion of DNA synthesis
Mitotic Checkpoint = Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC): Cell monitors formation of the spindle and kinetochore
attachment
The DNA replication
1. Origin licensing
The origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to the origins of replication on the DNA molecule during the G1 phase of the
cell cycle.
2. Origin firing
In S phase, the origin fires to unwind the DNA through the MCM Helicase and initiates replication.
3. DNA unwinding
The Helicase breaks down the hydrogen bonds between the pairs and Single-stranded binding proteins (SSBs) bind to the
single-stranded DNA to prevent the two strands from reannealing.
The separation of the DNA strands creates tension ahead of the replication fork, which can lead to the formation of
supercoils. These are cut by Topoisomerases.
4. RNA priming
Through the interaction of the replication fork with the replication proteins, the Primase is recruited, which synthesizes a
short RNA primer.
5. DNA Polymerization
Once the RNA primer is synthesized, DNA polymerase is recruited and begins to synthesize a new DNA strand by
extending the RNA primer (Okazaki Fragments on the lagging strand).
The RNA primer is removed by the enzyme RNase H, leaving a gap in the DNA backbone, which is filled by the DNA
polymerase. The remaining nicks are sealed by the DNA Ligase.
The Transcription
Eukaryotic Transcription Initiation Requires Specific Cis-Acting Sites like:
• Promotors: serve as recognition sites for transcription machinery
- Core promoter: Determines accurate initiation of transcription
- Proximal-promoter elements: Modulate efficiency of basal levels of transcription (CAAT & GC boxes)
• Enhancers: DNA sequences that can increase the transcriptional activity of a promoter (directs specificity of gene
expression)
• Silencers: DNA sequences that can repress transcription
• Insulators: DNA sequences that can block the spread of transcriptional activation or repression from one regulatory
region to another.
Transcription Factors (TFs) bind to the cis-acting sites of genes regulating expression
They have two functional domains: DNA-binding domain & Trans-activating domain (Activates or represses
transcription)
Activators increase transcription initiation Repressors decrease transcription initiation
1. Initiation
The pre-initiation complex (PIC) binds to promoter regions and recruit RNA polymerases, which begin to unwind the
DNA to expose the template strand.
2. Elongation
The RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand and produces an RNA-Molecule.
3. Termination
The RNA Polymerase reaches the terminator, which signals the end of the gene being transcribed. The RNA polymerase
and the newly synthesized RNA molecule dissociate from the DNA template and the RNA molecule undergoes post-
transcriptional processing to become a mature mRNA.
post-transcriptional processes
Splicing
➔ introns are removed from pre-mRNA, and exons are joined together (done by spliceosome)
Different mRNAs and proteins made from one gene are called isoforms
Types of Alternative Splicing:
1) Cassette exons are alternative exons in pre-mRNA molecules that can be alternatively included or excluded
during alternative splicing.
2) Alternative splice site are different splice site sequences that can be used during alternative splicing of pre-
mRNA molecules.
3) Intron retention - an intron is not spliced out of the pre-mRNA molecule and is retained in the mature mRNA
transcript.
4) Mutually exclusive exons are alternative exons in pre-mRNA molecules that are exclusive to one another,
meaning that only one of them can be included in the mature mRNA transcript.
5) Alternative promoters are different DNA sequences located upstream of a gene that can be used to initiate
transcription and generate different mRNA transcripts from the same gene.
6) Alternative polyadenylation is a type of post-transcriptional RNA processing that involves the cleavage and
polyadenylation of pre-mRNA at different sites, leading to the generation of mRNA transcripts with different 3'
untranslated regions (UTRs).
5’-Capping
➔ a guanosine is attached and methylated to the 5' end of the pre-mRNA
This cap structure protects the mRNA from degradation and is also required for efficient translation.
3’-Polyadenylation
➔ Following splicing, a poly(A) tail consisting of multiple adenosine nucleotides is added to the 3' end of the mRNA.
This tail serves to protect the mRNA from degradation, and also plays a role in regulating mRNA stability and translation
efficiency.
The Translation
Translation is the process of using the information from an mRNA to create a protein.
1. the small ribosome subunit first binds to the 5' methylguanosine cap and scans the mRNA until it encounters a
matching AUG.
2. The first amino acid of the resulting chain is methionine (coded by ATG/AUG). In most proteins, it is removed after
translation
3. The tRNA that matches the second codon comes next. The first elongation step begins with the peptide bond
between the first and the second amino acid.
Stop codons only terminate translation if they are in frame.
The Kozak sequence
the sequence surrounding the start codon influences the binding of the ribosome to the mRNA molecule, and the
strength of this interaction can affect the rate of translation initiation.
Chromosome organization
Euchromatin refers to the less compact arranged form of
chromatin
- more accessible to transcription factors & RNA
polymerase.
- often found in the arms of chromosomes
- contains actively transcribed genes that are required
for cellular functions.
Heterochromatin is a highly compact and tightly packed
form of chromatin
- repetitive sequences and transposable elements
- often located near the centromeres and telomeres
- involved in chromosome organization &
maintenance of chromosome stability.
SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) -Proteins
➔ form large complexes that help to organize and regulate DNA
Example:
• Cohesin complex, which consists of four subunits, including two SMC proteins (SMC1 and SMC3) → holds the
sister chromatids together & forms TADs (Topologically Associated Domains)
• Condensin complex, which consists of five subunits, including two SMC proteins (SMC2 and SMC4). → helps to
ensure accurate chromosome segregation.
Condensin I organizes the DNA into large loops Condensin II compacts the large loops into smaller loops.
Mutation and DNA Repair
Categorization of Mutations based on how the mutation impacts gene function:
Loss-of-function Mutations: Reduce (partial) or
completely prevent the function of a gene product.
Lethal Mutations: Disturb essential processes and are
incompatible with life.
Gain-of-function Mutations: Create gene products with
novel or enhanced functions.
Neutral Mutations: Do not influence the phenotype.
Most mutations fall into this category.
Conditional Mutations: Display a phenotype dependent
on external (environmental) conditions.
Different Consequences of Base Substitutions on a Gene Product:
Missense Mutation - non-conservative
(Properties of new amino acids are different from those of Tyr)
Missense Mutation - conservative
(Properties of new amino acids are similar to those of Tyr)
Nonsense Mutation
(Precocious termination of translation →truncated protein)
Silent Mutation
(No change of amino acid due to mutated base)
Categorization of Mutations is based on the physical change to the DNA:
DNA Mutations
Substitution = replacement of a DNA base by another one
Deletion or Insertion = One or more base pairs are removed or added
Chromosome Mutations
1. Deletion: A deletion occurs when a segment of DNA is lost from a chromosome.
2. Duplication: A duplication occurs when a segment of DNA is copied and inserted into the
chromosome, resulting in an extra copy of that segment.
3. Inversion: a chromosome is reversed end-to-end.
➔ This can happen through errors in DNA replication or recombination.
• Chromosome translocations: a segment of one chromosome breaks off and becomes attached to a non-
homologous chromosome.
Changes in chromosome number
Polyploidy Aneuploidy
The whole set of chromosomes is multiplied
(Triploidy, Tetraploidy, ...)
Individual chromosomes are present or are missing
(trisomy, monosomy) – missegregation
Chromosome segregation errors are much more common in oocyte meiosis than in mitosis
Causes of Mutations
• Endogenous Causes (inevitable)
 Replication errors (Insertion or Deletion = Replication Slippage)
 DNA Damage caused by reactive Oxygen Species (O2-, OH, H2O2) as a consequence of natural cellular metabolism
Hydrolytic fission = breaking of a chemical bond using a molecule of water (H2O). Can lead to spontaneous Deamination
of bases or to Depurination.
 Transposon-Insertion: Mobile DNA sequences can insert into a gene and change its sequence
(Class 1) Retrotransposons perform Reverse Transcription in order to integrate itself into the genome and produce more
copies of itself.
(Class 2) DNA-Transposons insert themselves through Transposases in other sequences.
• Exogenous Causes (Natural and Human Made)
 High-energy radiation act in two ways: 1) directly by the Induction of Breaks in DNA 2) indirectly by the formation
of cellular Oxygen Radicals
Dimerization of consecutive bases occurs when two adjacent nucleotides in the DNA strand form a covalent bond,
leading to the formation of a dimer. (in particular Thymines)
Deamination: Guanine becomes Xanthine (still pairs with Cytosine) & Cytosine becomes Uracil
Oxidation by Free Radicals: This C:G→ T:A Transversion is one of the most frequent mutations found in human tumours.
Methylation by the enzyme Sadenosylmethionine (SAM), which normally targets RNA and protein.
 Chemical Mutagen interact with DNA and cause changes
Intercalating Substances: incorporation of planar molecules between neighboring base pairs leads to structural changes
of the double helix.
DNA Repair and Recombination
Mismatch Repair (MMR)
When bases during the replication don’t pair the new base is removed by an endonuclease, the gap is filled by the DNA
Polymerase and the nick is closed by the DNA ligase.
Prokaryotes: Proteins MutS and MutL recognize the mismatched base pair and recruit the endonuclease MutH.
Eukaryotes: is similar but involves additional proteins, including the MutS homologs MSH2 and MSH6, which recognize
the mismatch, and the MutL homologs MLH1 and PMS2, which coordinate the repair process.
 The damage is recognized by the mismatches and distortions in the helix
Base Excision Repair (BER)
It is responsible for removing a single, damaged base and replacing it with a correct one. BER occurs when the DNA is
damaged by chemical agents, such as oxidation, or by spontaneous hydrolysis.
 The damage is recognized by DNA glycosylases
Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)
It corrects a variety of DNA lesions that distort the DNA helix, including bulky adducts, cross-links, and pyrimidine
dimers caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light.
 The damage is recognized by proteins that scan the DNA
Repair of Double-Stranded Breaks (DSBs)
1. Homology-independent Repair: Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ) & Single-Strand Annealing (SSA)
2. Homology-dependent Repair (Recombinational Repair)
GENE EXPRESSION
Lecture 5,
Regulation of transcription
Positive regulation: Activation induced upon specific signal.
In all other times transcription is constitutively repressed
Negative regulation: Inactivation of transcription
once sufficient levels of protein have been produced
The lac-operon
Enables E- coli to process lactose (instead of glucose) for energy and encodes for:
• Permease transports lactose into the cells.
• β-Galactosidase processes lctose into galactose and glucose
• Trans-acetylase processes potentially toxic side-products of the reaction
The regulation is mediated by the lac repressor, which binds to the lac operator.
➔ When lactose is absent, the lac repressor binds tightly to the operator and prevents RNA polymerase from
transcribing the genes in the lac operon.
➔ When lactose is present, it is converted to allolactose, which binds to the lac repressor and causes a conformational
change that weakens its binding to the operator. This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and initiate
transcription of the lac operon.
The regulation can also be done by catabolite-repression of the lac operon - bacteria preferentially use glucose as an
energy source over other sugar. It is mediated by the catabolite activator protein (CAP), which binds to a DNA sequence
called the CAP site.
➔ When glucose levels are low, the level of cAMP in the cell increases. This increase in cAMP levels causes cAMP to
bind to CAP, causing a conformational change that allows it to bind to the CAP site. This binding of CAP to the CAP
site enhances the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter and increases the rate of transcription of the lac
operon.
➔ When glucose levels are high, the level of cAMP in the cell decreases. This decrease in cAMP levels causes CAP to
dissociate from the CAP site, and RNA polymerase binds weakly to the promoter. As a result, the rate of transcription
of the lac operon is reduced.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posttranscriptional gene regulation
In Bacteria, two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation by modifying secondary structure of RNA are
known:
Attenuation - controls gene expression by regulating
transcription termination within the leader sequence of
an mRNA molecule.
Riboswitches – controls gene expression by
conformational change that affects the secondary
structure of the mRNA molecule.
In eukaryots the major mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation is alternative splicing, which allows for the
generation of different mRNA isoforms from a single gene. Another important mechanism is mRNA degradation.
Deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay
The poly(A) tail is a string of adenine nucleotides added to the 3' end of mRNA during transcription and is important for
the stability and translation efficiency. When the poly(A) tail and the 5’cap are removed, the mRNA molecule becomes
unstable and is targeted for degradation.
1) Exoribonuclease enzymes shorten length of poly-A
2) Decapping enzymes removes 7-methylguanine cap mRNA
3) Endonuclease cleaves mRNA internally
Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)
is a surveillance mechanism that targets mRNA transcripts containing premature stop codons (PTCs) for degradation.
This mechanism helps to prevent the production of truncated proteins that could be harmful to the cell.
RNA-induced gene silencing (RIGS) or RNA interference (RNAi)
is a mechanism of gene regulation that involves the use of small RNA molecules to silence or reduce the expression of
target genes → they can an bind to the target mRNA and induce its degradation, preventing its translation into protein
or they inhibit translation by blocking the ribosome from accessing the mRNA, alternatively by inducing its sequestration
in processing bodies (P-bodies) or stress granules.
Posttranslational Modifications Regulate Protein Activity
• Phosphorylation- a phosphate group is added to a specific amino acid residue on a protein.
Carried out by kinases, which transfer a phosphate group from ATP to the target protein.
Phosphatases are enzymes that remove phosphates
➔ Phosphorylation usually induces conformational changes and therefore functional changes in proteins
• Ubiquitin-Mediated Protein Degradation - a protein targeted for degradation, is modified with ubiquitin
Ubiquitinated proteins are recognized by the proteasome (protein cleaving activity)
➔ The proteasome unwinds target proteins, removes their ubiquitin tags, and breaks the protein into small peptides
about 7–8 amino acids long
• Gene regulation by lncRNAs - Long noncoding RNAs bind to and interact with chromatinmodifying enzymes and
regulate chromatin structure and gene expression
For example, the lncRNA Xist is involved in X-chromosome inactivation in female mammals by recruiting chromatin
modifiers to silence genes on one of the two X chromosomes.
EPIGENETICS
Lecture 6
Epigenetics refers to the study of changes in gene expression that occur without changes to the underlying DNA
sequence. The epigenome refers to the epigenetic state of a cell.
During its life-span, a multicellular organism has one genome, but this genome can be modified in diverse cell types at
different times to produce many epigenomes. The genome is identical in most cells of the adult body, whereas the
epigenome is distinct in each cell identity.
Totipotent cell
All cell types can be
generated
Pluripotent cell
All embryonic cells can be
generated
Multipotent progenitor cell
Multiple cell fates ca be
established
Terminally differentiated cells
No more differentiation or self-
renewal potential
three major mechanisms in which Epigenetic changes occur:
1. DNA-Methylation - by the addition or removal of methyl groups (reversible process by Tet enzymes)
CpG islands are typically unmethylated, this allows for the binding of transcription factors and other proteins that are
necessary for the proper expression of genes.
However, in certain diseases, such as cancer, CpG islands can become hypermethylated and this can lead to the silencing
of genes that are important for regulating cell growth and differentiation.
Heterochromatic methylation typically occurs in repetitive DNA sequences (transposable elements &satellite DNA)
which are found in the centromeres and telomeres of chromosomes. These regions are essential for proper
chromosome segregation during cell division, and their integrity is critical for maintaining genomic stability.
DNA Methylation is crucially involved in…
• X chromosome inactivation: in mammalian females one X chromosome is inactivated by converting them into
heterochromatin (dosage compensation) - Once inactivated, the same X chromosome remains silenced in all cells descended
from this progenitor cell
• CpG methylation in euchromatic regions causes a parentspecific pattern (determined during gamete formation) of
gene transcription involved in genomic imprinting (often occur in clusters)

Kinship theory: fight for parental resources leads to genomic imprinting
Mother wants to protect her resources for further pregnancies
- maternal genes are growth reducing
Father wants to take maximum maternal resources for his
offspring - paternal controlled genes are growth promoting
Example: Igf2 vs Igf2r
Igf2 receptor (Igf2r) is a growth-inhibiting gene that is
expressed from the maternal allele and repressed on the
paternal allele.
Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene that is expressed from the
paternal allele and repressed on the maternal allele
For example, in cases where the maternal allele of Igf2 is silenced due to a genetic mutation or epigenetic alteration, the fetus may
overexpress Igf2 and grow abnormally large, a condition known as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
Most imprinted genes are expressed from the paternal allele
2. Histone modification and chromatin remodeling
The N-termini of histones protrude out of the octamere and the amino acids can be covalently modified by acetylation,
methylation, and phosphorylation. Chemical modification of histones alters the structure of chromatin, making genes
accessible or inaccessible for transcription.
Acetylation by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) opens the chromatin structure → Makes gene regulatory sequences
available for transcription
Removal of the acetyl groups by histone deacetylase (HDAC) closes the configuration → Silences genes by making them
unavailable
3. Often noncoding RNas are involved in epigenetic processes
Imprinting disorders
Angelman syndrome
= caused by absence / dysfunction of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene of chromosome 15 (dominating paternal
imprinting cluster)
= neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and speech impairment
Prader-Willi syndrome
= caused by the dominating maternal imprint cluster of chromosome 15
= characterized by obesity, hypotonia, and food-seeking behaviors.
WORKING WITH DNA, PCR AND SEQUENCING
Lecture 7
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
➔ Copies specific DNA sequence via in vitro reactions; can amplify target DNA sequences present in very small
quantities. – requires 2 primers
1) Denaturation: DNA sample is heated (usually around 95°C) to denature the double-strand and separate the two
complementary strands.
2) Annealing: The sample is cooled (usually between 55°C) to allow short DNA primers to anneal (bind) to
complementary sequences on each of the single-stranded DNA templates.
3) Extension: A heat-stable DNA polymerase enzyme (such as Taq polymerase, 72°C) is added, along with a supply of
deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). The polymerase enzyme then extends the primers, synthesizing new
strands of DNA.
➔ Repeat using thermocyclerz (DNA st rand is doubled in each cycle)
Limitations of PCR:
Some information about nucleotide sequence
of target DNA is required to synthesize primers
Minor contamination from other
sources can cause problems
PCR cannot well amplify long DNA
fragments
Different flavours of PCR:
Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
Used to generate cDNA, which can be used further as template in PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
Used to quantify amplification reactions as they occur in real time
Restriction Enzymes - DNA-cutting enzymes
Bind to DNA at specific recognition sequence (restriction site) and cleave DNA to produce one or more linear DNA
fragments (so called restriction fragments) = DNA digestion
Palindromes are sequences that read the same backwards as forwards and are often recognition sites for restriction
enzymes. (Example: "GATATC")
Restriction enzymes cut DNA in a characteristic cleavage pattern.
Sticky ends (cohesive ends): Fragments produced with
overhangs
Blunt ends: Fragments produced with double- stranded
ends
Plasmid Vectors for cloning
➔ Serves as vehicle to replicate cloned DNA fragments in host cell.
Replicate independently from chromosomes within bacterial cells (have an origin of replication) and due to several
restriction enzyme sites, they can insert into a DNA fragment.
Alternative Vector systems
• Phage vector systems
• Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs)
• yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs)
Cloning by Gibson assembly
First, the DNA fragments to be assembled are amplified by PCR, with primers that generate overlapping sequences at
the ends of each fragment.
Next, the fragments are mixed with three enzymes. The 5' exonuclease chews back the 5' ends of the DNA fragments,
exposing the overlapping regions. The DNA polymerase fills in the gaps between the overlapping regions, and the DNA
ligase seals the nicks, joining the fragments into a larger piece of DNA.
The assembled DNA can then be transformed into bacteria, where it can be selected and propagated for further
analysis.
It is a one-step, seamless cloning technique that eliminates the need for restriction enzymes, ligases, and other enzymes
that can cause unwanted mutations or rearrangements in the cloned DNA.
Transformation
= introducing plasmids into bacteria:

pulse DNA into cells
Electroporation: A brief high-intensity pulse of electricity
‘pushes’ plasmid DNA into bacterial cells
How to identify bacteria that have taken up the correct plasmid?
Blue-White Screening
A plasmid vector containing a gene encoding beta-galactosidase is used to transform cells. The MCS is located within
the beta-galactosidase gene, so if a DNA fragment is inserted into the MCS, it disrupts the beta-galactosidase gene and
prevents the production of functional beta-galactosidase.
To distinguish between recombinant and non-recombinant colonies, a substrate called X-gal is added;
• If a colony has a functional beta-galactosidase gene (non-recombinant), it will produce blue colonies
• If a colony has a disrupted beta-galactosidase gene due to the insertion of a DNA fragment in the MCS
(recombinant), it will not produce functional beta-galactosidase = white colonies
Principles of RNA or DNA FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a technique used in molecular biology and genetics to detect the presence or
absence of specific DNA or RNA sequences in cells and tissues.
The DNA or RNA within the cells is denatured and hybridizes with the target sequences, which are Fluorescently
labeled. The probes are designed to be specific to the target sequences and are labeled with fluorescent dyes that emit a
particular color when excited by light.
Restriction Maps
show the locations and relative distances between the restriction sites on a DNA molecule.
The process of generating a restriction map involves digesting a DNA sample with one or more restriction enzymes,
which cut the DNA at specific recognition sequences, and then analyzing the resulting fragments by gel electrophoresis
or other methods.
➔ Smallest fragments move farthest down on gel
Nucleic Acid Blotting - Southern blot
is a technique used to detect and analyze specific DNA sequences in a sample.
➔ Determines whether clone contains all or part of a gene
Methodology: Hybridization between complementary nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) molecules
Only those bands containing DNA sequences complementary to the probe show hybridization.
DNA – Sequencing - Sanger Sequencing / Dideoxynucleotide chain-termination sequencing
1. PCR amplification: The DNA sequence of interest is first amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which
generates multiple copies of the DNA fragment.
2. Fragmentation: The amplified DNA is then fragmented into smaller pieces using a restriction enzyme or physical
shearing.
3. Primer annealing: primers anneal to the ends of the target sequence.
4. Sequencing reaction: DNA polymerase, dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), and normal deoxynucleotides (dNTPs). Are
used. The ddNTPs are labeled with a fluorescent dye, and terminate DNA synthesis when they are incorporated into
the growing DNA chain.
5. Gel electrophoresis: The resulting fragments are separated by size using gel electrophoresis, and the fluorescence of
each ddNTP is detected.
➔ The sequence of the DNA fragment is read by analyzing the order and intensity of the fluorescent signals.
GENOMICS
Lecture 8
How to identify genes from DNA sequence
1. Look for that have an open reading frame (ORF)
Usually begins with ATG (encodes for the amino acidic methionine; AUG at RNA level) and ends with a stop codon (TAA,
TAG or TGA [UAA,UAG,UGA]).
Statistically there is a stop codon every 16 triplets.
2. Look for GC vs AT distribution that is close to 50:50. Genomic background is rather AT rich.
3. Look for characteristic reguatory sequences (CpG Islands, TATA-Box, Transcription initiator…)
A final determination of the exon/intron structure and the exact transcription start site can only be determined by additional experiments
such as RNA sequencing.
Alu-rich parts of the genome are associated with regions with lots of genes (green)
Functional Genomics - Study of gene functions
Prediction of gene function → BLAST searches (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool): A genome sequence statistically
similar to gene with known function likely encodes for protein with similar function
Prediction of protein domains helps predicting protein function
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)
is a technique used to identify the locations where a particular protein of interest binds to chromatin.
Tool for studying the regulation of gene expression and the role of transcription factors, histone modifications, and other
chromatin-associated proteins in gene regulation.
Massive parallel single-cell analysis using droplet-based single-cell preparation
is a technique used to analyze the gene expression of individual cells in a high-throughput manner.
The resulting data can be used to identify different cell types, measure gene expression levels, and identify genes that
are differentially expressed between cells or cell populations.
Proteomics - Study of the proteome
Immunoprecipitation to purify and co-purify proteins
The technique involves the use of antibodies that specifically recognize and bind to the target protein or protein
complex, allowing it to be isolated from the rest of the sample.
The resulting eluted protein can be analyzed by various methods.
Mass spectrometry (MS)
is an analytical technique that is used to measure the massto-charge ratio of ions.
➔ identifies which proteins are present in a complex mixture of proteins
MENDELIAN GENETICS
Lecture 9
Mendel´s Postulates
1. Unit Factors occur in pairs - Genetic characters are controlled by unit factors existing in pairs in individual organisms
The underlying cause of this is the diploid nature of many eukaryotic genomes; each gene comes in two copies: one
inherited from the father, on from the mother (exception are sex chromosomes)
2. Dominance/Recessiveness - When two distinct unique factors responsible for a single character are present in a single
individual, one unit factor is dominant over the other, which is said to be recessive
3. Random Segregation - During the formation of gametes, the paired unit factors separate, or segregate, randomly so
that each gamete receives one or the other with equal likelihood.
4. Independent Assortment - During gamete formation, segregating pairs of unit factors assort independently of each
other
This rule explains the distribution of multiple genetic traits, e.g., in a plant that is tall and carries pink flowers, both traits
are independently inherited.
In principle this would mean that each of the 20,000 genes is inherited independently, but that is not the case (due to
the nature of meiosis, neighboring genes have a higher probability to be co-inherited)
GENETICS AND DISEASE
Lecture 11
Forms of inheritance of gene mutations:
Autosomal dominant
Autosomal recessive
the trait-causing gene is on a non-sex chromosome.
X-chromosomal recessive
X-chromosomal dominant
the trait-causing gene is on a sex chromosome (X or Y).
There are no known Y-chromosomal hereditary diseases in humans.
Autosomal dominant inheritance
Autosomal dominant inheritance is a type in which a single copy of a disease-causing gene is sufficient. This means that
an individual with an autosomal dominant disorder has a 50% chance of passing the disease-causing gene to each of
their offspring.
Achondroplasia
Cause: missense mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene FGFR3.
➔ leads to premature ossification of the cartilage in the bone growth zone and therefore v. a. to shorten the
extremities.
Huntington disease
Cause: by trinucleotide repeats result in aberrant proteins
➔ Mutated huntingtin protein cannot be broken down and accumulates in neurons over time: neurodegeneration
causes dementia, incoordination, and eventually death.
Autosomal recessive inheritance
Individual must inherit two copies of a disease-causing gene to develop the associated disorder. If only one copy is
inherited, they are considered a carrier.
Since both parents must be carriers of the disease-causing gene for their child to be affected, the chance of having an
affected child is 25% with each pregnancy, 50% chance that the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance that the child
will be healthy.
Sickle cell anemia
Cause: a valine instead of a glutamic acid at position 6 of the β chain causes the phenotype
➔ Sickle cell hemoglobin is not globular but filamentous. With low oxygen pressure such as at high altitudes, the
erythrocytes are deformed and fragile.
Heterozygous carriers have a resistance to malaria, explains why this disease is so prevalent in certain populations.
X-linked recessive inheritance
Since females have two X chromosomes, they can be carriers of X-linked disorders. Males, however, have only one X
chromosome and are more likely to be affected by X-linked disorders.
Hemophilia A ("hemophilia")
Cause: by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII (FVIII)
➔ results in impaired blood clotting and can lead to prolonged bleeding episodes, which can be severe and life-
threatening.
X-linked dominant inheritance
If a female has one copy of the mutated gene, she is affected with the condition, and if a male inherits the mutated
gene, he will also be affected because he only has one X chromosome.
If an affected female has children, she has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of her children, regardless
of their sex.
If an affected male has children, he will pass the mutated gene to all of his daughters, but none of his sons, because he
only passes his Y chromosome to his sons.
Hypophosphatemia
Cause: X-linked autosomal dominant hypophosphatemia
➔ abnormally low level of phosphate in the blood.
de Novo mutations that lead to disease
Dominant mutations that prevent reproduction are typically acquired de novo (not inherited). These are typically very
rare.
Progeria
extremely rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder in which patients appear to age extremely rapidly. Often caused
my mutations in lamins, which support the shape and function of nuclei.
Methods for determining the cause(s) of genetic diseases
• Identity by descent (IBD) mapping – Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are used to associate regions of
chromosomes with the phenotype between family members.
• Whole exome sequencing
• Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) – For cases where many genes potentially contribute to a phenotype,
correlations between SNPs and phenotype can be performed for thousands of individuals independently of any
knowledge of family history
GENETICS OF CANCER
Lecture 12
Cancers are defined by uncontrolled cell growth and division. Tumors typically from over the course of many years.
During this time, a series of different mutations occur until enough tumorigenic changes occur to allow for unregulated
growth.
When cells accumulate large amounts of DNA damage, they ordinarily undergo programmed cell death = apoptosis →
most common cancer mutations prevent this.
In addition, the immune system targets cells with certain types of DNA damage. Cancer cells must therefore also evade
detection by the immune system.
Some sources of mutations are specific to certain types of cancer, depending on the tissues that they affect. However,
errors in DNA replication are by far the most common source of mutation and can affect any cell type.
The simplest way to get many mutations is to increase the rate at which mutations accumulate → genetic instability.
BRAF
is a proto-oncogene that encodes a protein called B-Raf, which is a member of the RAF family of serine/threonine
kinases. The RAF kinases are important components of a kinase cascade that transduces signals from the cell surface to
the nucleus, ultimately resulting in the activation of transcription factors that promote cell proliferation and survival.
BRAF is frequently mutated in human cancers, these result in a constitutively activated form of the protein that can drive
uncontrolled cell growth and division.
c-myc (MYC)
is a proto-oncogene that encodes a transcription factor called c-Myc, which is a key regulator of cell growth and
proliferation.
Aberrant activation of c-Myc is a common feature of many different types of cancer, and is often associated with
increased cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and altered metabolism.
Some cancer cells have dozens of copies of the genomic region that includes c-myc, leading to massive overexpression
and overactivation of the protein.
Telomerase (TERT)
needed by cancers to prevent the degradation of chromosome ends over time
Telomerase is an enzyme that adds telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes, which are essential for the stability
and integrity of the genome.
Cancer cells have a high level of telomerase activity, which enables them to maintain their telomeres and proliferate
indefinitely. Telomerase is reactivated in most cancers, and the expression of its catalytic subunit, telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT), is a critical step in the immortalization and transformation of cancer cells.
Telomerase is not frequently mutated in cancer. Instead, it is re-activated in differentiated tissues that would normally no
longer require telomerase activity.
Tumor suppressors
RB1
When mutated, it can no longer suppress E2F proteins. This results in permanent activation of cell proliferation genes.
P53 (TP53)
is part of a cellular response that senses DNA damage and prevents cell cycle progression until the damage has been
fixed. If the damage cannot be fixed, p53 signals for cell death instead.
In the absence of p53, cells can enter and progress through the cell cycle even in the presence of DNA damage.
Viruses that integrate into the genome often promote cancer
1) Disrupting tumor suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes where they insert into the genome.
2) Directly promoting cell proliferation (example – both HPV and EBV encode for a protein that inhibits RB1 expression)
Inherited cancer predisposition mutations
~5-10 percent of cancers are associated with inherited mutations. The rest are “sporadic” cancers.
Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) of tumor suppressor gene mutations
The “two-hit” hypothesis states that cancers require two separate mutational events to inactivate both copies of a tumor
suppressor gene. LOH is essentially a simplified way of getting the second hit from the two hit hypothesis. After the first
copy of the gene is mutated, the mutated copy can be transferred to the other chromosome through various
mechanisms such as gene conversion.
GENETIC ENGINEERING
Lecture 14
The first step in programmable genome engineering = creating DNA breaks at defined target loci
How to bring DNA into higher eukaryotic cells?
• Lipid nanoparticles – lipid packaged DNA
• Electroporation
• Direct Microinjection of DNA and/or proteins into embryos
• Viral vectors – commonly used are retroviral, lentiviral or adenoviral vectors
• Biolistic (Bio + balistic) transfection – Gene gun, DNA coated gold particles are shot at high speed into cells
Gene targeting by homologous recombination (HR)
Used for introducing precise genetic modifications into the genome of an organism. It involves the replacement of a
specific segment of DNA with a new sequence, by taking advantage of the cell's own DNA repair mechanisms.
Conditional gene targeting
used to manipulate gene expression in a specific cell type or at a specific developmental stage.
Inducible genetics using the Cre-Lox system
allows for the temporal control of gene expression, and is often used to study the function of genes. A conditional
knock out (KO) is a type of genetic modification that allows for the deletion of a gene of interest in a specific tissue or at
a specific developmental stage.
The Cre-Lox system involves the use of two genetic elements:
A Cre recombinase recognizes specific DNA
sequences known as loxP sites, leading to the
excision or inversion of the DNA sequence
between the loxP sites.
A targeting vector contains the gene of interest flanked by loxP sites and
regulatory elements that control its expression. It is introduced into the
genome of the organism, and the loxP sites allow for the gene to be excised
or inverted in response to Cre expression.
CRISPR-Cas9
The CRISPR-Cas9 system works by using a short RNA molecule, known as a guide RNA (gRNA), to target a specific DNA
sequence.
Once the gRNA is bound to the Cas9 enzyme, it forms a complex that can cut the DNA at the targeted site. This creates a
double-strand break (DSB) in the DNA, which triggers the cell's DNA repair mechanisms.
Two mechanisms can be activated:
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)
is an error-prone mechanism that often results in the
introduction of small insertions or deletions (indels) at
the site of the DSB, leading to a loss-of-function mutation
in the targeted gene.
homology-directed repair (HDR)
more precise mechanism that can be used to introduce
specific changes to the DNA sequence, such as
introducing a point mutation or inserting a new
sequence.
➔ Triggering HDR requires a homology donor
Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0
is a synthetic bacterium, which ws created by using genome transplantation, where the genome of a Mycoplasma
capricolum bacterium was replaced with a synthetic genome based on the DNA sequence of Mycoplasma mycoides.
The cell then began to read the synthetic DNA and produce proteins based on the new genetic code. Over time, the cell
divided and grew, creating a new population of bacteria that contained only the synthetic genome.
