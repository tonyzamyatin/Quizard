What are two ways in which posttranscriptional regulation can occur?;Posttranscriptional regulation can occur through changes in the secondary structure of the RNA or through modifications of the RNA molecule.
Name two ways in which bacteria control transcription/translation by modifying the secondary structure of RNA.;Bacteria control transcription/translation through attenuation and riboswitches.
What is attenuation?;Attenuation is the reduction of transcription through an attenuator sequence in operons responsible for amino acid synthesis.
What are riboswitches?;Riboswitches are conformation changes in the secondary structure of the 5' UTR or mRNA that are controlled by specific ligand-aptamer interactions.
What is the rule of thumb regarding gene expression in most cells?;In most cells, approximately half of the available genes are expressed, and the combination of expressed genes and their relative expression levels define the cell identity.
What are some key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression?;Some key differences include larger genome size and complexity, the presence of histones and chromatin in eukaryotes, spatial separation of transcription and translation in eukaryotes, and posttranscriptional processing of transcripts in eukaryotes.
What is chromatin remodeling?;Chromatin remodeling involves the repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA, which can make chromosome regions accessible to transcription regulatory proteins and RNA Pol II.
What are some examples of histone modifications?;Histone modifications include acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, which can affect the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and RNA Pol II.
What is DNA methylation?;DNA methylation is the covalent bonding of methyl groups onto cytosine residues in DNA, often in CpG doublets. It is associated with transcriptional silencing.
What are enhancers, silencers, and insulators?;Enhancers are sequences that regulate transcription and are located near or within genes. Silencers repress transcription, and insulators block or facilitate enhancer-promoter interactions.
