Why is it important to confirm bioinformatic gene predictions with empirical methods?; Bioinformatic gene predictions are based on algorithms and statistical analysis, but they can have false positives or miss important genes. Empirical methods like cDNA sequencing and knockout experiments provide direct evidence of gene presence and function.
What are the limitations of using recombination frequency to map genes?; Recombination frequency can be influenced by factors other than gene proximity, such as interference from multiple crossovers. It also assumes a linear relationship between genetic distance and physical distance, which may not always hold true.

How is the genetic deterioration of the Y chromosome related to its hemizygosity in males?; The Y chromosome carries fewer genes compared to the X chromosome, and over time, some of these genes may be lost or become pseudogenes. This genetic depletion of the Y chromosome contributes to males being more susceptible to X-linked recessive defects.
How does X-chromosomal dosage compensation ensure that females do not express twice as many X-chromosomal genes as males?; X-inactivation occurs in female embryos, where one of the X chromosomes becomes inactivated. This ensures that females have the same dosage of X-chromosomal genes as males.
Why is sexual reproduction considered inefficient compared to asexual reproduction?; Sexual reproduction requires the production of males, which do not directly produce offspring themselves. Additionally, finding suitable partners for sexual reproduction can be challenging, especially in spaced populations. However, sexual reproduction offers advantages such as genetic diversity and the potential for heterosis.
What are the potential long-term consequences of the genetic deterioration of the Y chromosome?; If the Y chromosome continues to lose genes, there may come a point where it becomes non-essential for male development. In the future, it is possible that the Y chromosome may be lost entirely, resulting in a lack of individuals with Y chromosomes. However, the human Y chromosome has only lost a single gene over the past 25 million years, suggesting that it may persist for a significant time.

Polygenic inheritance; The inheritance of traits that are controlled by the interaction of multiple genes.
Why are X-linked traits/diseases more commonly seen in males?; Males only have one X chromosome, so if they inherit a recessive X-linked mutation, they will express the trait/disease. Females have two X chromosomes, so they would need to inherit two copies of the mutated gene to express the trait/disease.
What is the purpose of dosage compensation in females?; Dosage compensation ensures that females do not express twice as many X-chromosomal genes as males. By inactivating one of the X chromosomes, the expression levels are balanced between males and females.
How are homeotic genes involved in the development of body segments and structures?; Homeotic genes control the expression of genes that determine the specific structures formed in each body segment. Mutations in these genes can lead to the formation of incorrect structures in different segments.
How is the heritability of a trait estimated?; The heritability of a trait can be estimated by comparing the genetic variance (VG) to the total phenotypic variance (VP) within a population. This can be done by scoring a large number of individuals under constant environmental conditions.

What are the different types of speciation?; Allopatric speciation occurs when populations are geographically separated, while sympatric speciation occurs within the distribution area of the founding species.
How might the bottleneck effect impact the genetic diversity and adaptability of a population?; The bottleneck effect can significantly reduce the genetic diversity of a population, resulting in a loss of potential adaptations and potentially making the population more vulnerable to environmental changes or diseases.
Why might the founder effect lead to an increased prevalence of a rare allele?; The founder effect occurs when a rare allele becomes more prevalent in a population due to random chance. This can happen if a small group of individuals with that allele becomes the founding population of a new area, leading to its increased prevalence in that population.
Consider the possible consequences of non-random mating preferences or partner choice in a population. How might it impact the genetic makeup and health of the population in the long term?; Non-random mating preferences, such as female preference for certain characteristics, can lead to a decrease in genetic diversity and potentially increase the prevalence of harmful alleles. This could have negative impacts on the overall health and adaptability of the population.
