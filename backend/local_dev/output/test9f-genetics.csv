How does autosomal dominant inheritance differ from autosomal recessive inheritance?; Autosomal dominant inheritance only requires a single copy of the disease-causing gene, while autosomal recessive inheritance requires two copies. This means that an affected individual with an autosomal dominant disorder has a 50% chance of passing the gene to each offspring, while in autosomal recessive inheritance, both parents must be carriers for the child to be affected, resulting in a 25% chance of having an affected child.
What are the characteristics of X-linked recessive inheritance?; X-linked recessive inheritance means that the disease-causing gene is located on the X chromosome.
