What are some examples of posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms?;Some examples of posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms include changes in RNA secondary structure, covalent modifications of RNA, and changes in RNA stability.
What are the two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation by modifying the secondary structure of RNA in bacteria?;The two principal manners are attenuation and riboswitches.
What is attenuation?;Attenuation is the reduction of transcription through an attenuator sequence. It is a feature of operons responsible for amino acid synthesis.
What are riboswitches?;Riboswitches are conformational changes in the secondary structure of mRNA. They can be controlled by a large number of ligands, such as amino acids, vitamins, sugars, and metal ions.
What is the role of chromatin remodelling in gene expression regulation?;Chromatin remodelling involves repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA, which makes certain regions of the chromosome accessible to transcription regulatory proteins and RNA Pol II.
What are some examples of histone modifications?;Examples of histone modifications include acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation. These modifications can influence the accessibility of DNA for transcription factors and RNA Pol II.
What is DNA methylation?;DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine base of a CpG dinucleotide. It is associated with transcriptional silencing and plays a role in gene regulation.
What are cis-acting sequences?;Cis-acting sequences are nucleotide sequences on the same chromosome as the gene they regulate. They include promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, and are required for accurate regulated transcription of genes.
What is the role of enhancers in gene expression regulation?;Enhancers are short genomic elements that regulate the transcription of target genes. They are important for achieving maximum levels of transcription and for cell type-specific gene expression.
What is the difference between focused promoters and dispersed promoters?;Focused promoters have a specific transcription initiation site, while dispersed promoters direct initiation from multiple weak start sites.
