Autosomal dominant inheritance; A type of inheritance where a single copy of a disease-causing gene is sufficient to develop the associated disorder.
Autosomal recessive inheritance; A type of inheritance where two copies of a disease-causing gene are required to develop the associated disorder.
X-linked recessive inheritance; A type of inheritance where the disease-causing gene is located on the X chromosome, and males are more commonly affected.
X-linked dominant inheritance; A type of inheritance where one copy of the disease-causing gene on the X chromosome is sufficient to develop the disorder.
De novo mutations; Mutations that occur for the first time in an individual and are not inherited from parents.
Genetic instability; An increased rate at which mutations accumulate, leading to an unstable genome.
BRAF; A proto-oncogene frequently mutated in human cancers, leading to a constitutively activated form of the B-Raf protein.
c-myc (MYC); A proto-oncogene encoding a transcription factor that regulates cell growth and proliferation, often aberrantly activated in cancer.
Telomerase (TERT); An enzyme that adds telomere repeats to chromosome ends, frequently reactivated in cancer cells to maintain their telomeres and proliferate indefinitely.
Tumor suppressors; Genes that normally regulate cell growth and prevent the formation of tumors. Mutations in these genes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and increased cancer risk.
How does the mode of inheritance (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked) affect the likelihood of developing a genetic disorder?; The mode of inheritance determines the probability of an individual developing a genetic disorder. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that a single copy of the disease-causing gene is sufficient for an individual to develop the disorder, while autosomal recessive inheritance requires two copies of the gene. X-linked recessive inheritance affects males more frequently because they only have one X chromosome, while X-linked dominant inheritance affects both males and females, with different inheritance patterns. Understanding the mode of inheritance is crucial for predicting the risk of passing on a genetic disorder to future generations.
How do de novo mutations contribute to the development of genetic disorders?; De novo mutations are new mutations that occur for the first time in an individual and are not inherited from parents. These mutations can arise spontaneously during DNA replication or as a result of environmental factors. De novo mutations can lead to the development of genetic disorders by disrupting the normal function of genes or altering gene regulation. They can occur in any type of gene, including those involved in cell growth, development, and DNA repair. The presence of de novo mutations can explain cases where there is no family history of a genetic disorder and can provide important insights into the underlying causes of diseases.
c-myc (MYC); A proto-oncogene that encodes a transcription factor called c-Myc, which is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation.
Telomerase (TERT); An enzyme that adds telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes, which are essential for the stability and integrity of the genome.
RB1; A tumor suppressor gene that, when mutated, can no longer suppress E2F proteins, resulting in permanent activation of cell proliferation genes.
P53 (TP53); A tumor suppressor gene that senses DNA damage and prevents cell cycle progression until the damage is fixed. If the damage cannot be fixed, p53 signals for cell death instead.
Viruses; Can integrate into the genome and promote cancer by disrupting tumor suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes, or by directly promoting cell proliferation.
Inherited cancer predisposition mutations; Mutations that are inherited and associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH); The phenomenon where a second hit to a tumor suppressor gene occurs, resulting in the inactivation of both copies of the gene.
Gene targeting by homologous recombination (HR); A technique used to introduce precise genetic modifications into the genome by replacing a specific segment of DNA with a new sequence.
Conditional gene targeting; Manipulating gene expression in a specific cell type or at a specific developmental stage.
Inducible genetics using the Cre-Lox system; Allowing for temporal control of gene expression by using the Cre recombinase to excise or invert DNA sequences flanked by loxP sites.
CRISPR-Cas9; A system that uses a guide RNA (gRNA) to target specific DNA sequences and create double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA, triggering the cell's DNA repair mechanisms.
Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0; A synthetic bacterium created by replacing the genome of a Mycoplasma capricolum bacterium with a synthetic genome based on Mycoplasma mycoides.
What is the role of c-myc in cancer?; Aberrant activation of c-Myc is a common feature of many types of cancer and is associated with increased cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and altered metabolism.
How do cancer cells maintain their telomeres?; Cancer cells have high levels of telomerase activity, which adds telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes, allowing them to maintain telomeres and proliferate indefinitely.
What is the "two-hit" hypothesis of cancer?; The "two-hit" hypothesis states that cancers require two separate mutational events to inactivate both copies of a tumor suppressor gene. Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) is a simplified way of obtaining the second hit.
How does the Cre-Lox system work in inducible genetics?; The Cre recombinase recognizes specific DNA sequences called loxP sites and can excise or invert the DNA sequence between the loxP sites, allowing for temporal control of gene expression.
How does the CRISPR-Cas9 system create genetic modifications?; The system uses a guide RNA (gRNA) to target specific DNA sequences and create double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA. The cell's DNA repair mechanisms can then introduce small insertions or deletions (NHEJ) or more precise changes to the DNA sequence (HDR).
What are the potential ethical implications of using gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 to modify the human genome?; Some ethical concerns include the potential for unintended consequences or off-target effects, the creation of "designer babies" or enhancement of certain traits, and unequal access to these technologies.
How might the presence of inherited cancer predisposition mutations affect an individual's decisions regarding preventive measures or treatment options?; Knowing that one has an inherited mutation associated with an increased risk of cancer may influence decisions such as undergoing more frequent screenings, considering prophylactic surgeries, or opting for targeted therapies. It may also impact decisions regarding family planning or genetic counseling.
What are some potential limitations or challenges in the field of genetic engineering that need to be addressed for its wider application in various fields?; Some challenges include off-target effects or unintended consequences of genetic modifications, the efficiency and delivery of gene editing tools into cells or organisms, ethical considerations, and the need for more precise and reliable techniques for specific modifications.
