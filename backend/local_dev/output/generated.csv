What are the two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation in bacteria after transcription?;Attenuation and riboswitches.
What is attenuation and where is it commonly found?;Attenuation is the reduction of transcription through an attenuator sequence. It is commonly found in operons responsible for amino acid synthesis, such as the trp operon.
What are riboswitches and how do they regulate gene expression?;Riboswitches are conformation changes in the secondary structure of the 5â€™ UTR or mRNA. They can be controlled by specific ligand-aptamer interactions, leading to modulation of transcription or translation.
What is the rule of thumb regarding gene expression in most cells?;In most cells, approximately half of the available genes are expressed, and the combination of expressed genes and their relative expression level define the cell identity.
What are the key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression?;Some key differences include the larger genome size and complexity in eukaryotes, the presence of chromatin and histones in eukaryotes, the spatial separation of transcription and translation in eukaryotes, and the processing of transcripts and transport to the cytoplasm/export from the nucleus in eukaryotes.
What are the multiple levels of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes?;Chromatin remodelling and regulatory histone modifications, splicing and RNA processing, regulation of RNA export from nucleus to cytoplasm, mRNA stability/degradation, and control of translation rates.
How does chromatin remodelling affect gene expression?;Chromatin remodelling involves repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA, making chromosome regions accessible to transcription regulatory proteins and RNA Pol II.
What are histone modifications and how do they influence gene expression?;Histone modifications involve covalent bonding of functional groups onto histone proteins, such as acetyl, methyl, and phosphate. These modifications can alter the affinity of histones to DNA, making it more or less accessible to transcription factors and RNA Pol II.
What is DNA methylation and how does it affect gene expression?;DNA methylation occurs on the cytosine of CG doublets in DNA and is associated with transcriptional silencing. Methylation rates are higher in CpG di-nucleotides, except for CpG islands found in promoters, which have lower methylation rates.
What are the cis-acting sequences involved in eukaryotic transcription initiation?;Cis-acting sequences include promoters, which are recognition sites for the transcription machinery, and enhancers, silencers, and insulators, which regulate the transcription of regulatory elements and affect the level and specificity of gene expression.
