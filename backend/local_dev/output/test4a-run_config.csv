What is posttranscriptional regulation?; Posttranscriptional regulation refers to the regulation of gene expression that occurs after transcription, through interactions with specific molecules that can modify RNA stability, secondary structure, or establish covalent modifications of RNA.
What are the two principal manners of controlling transcription/translation by modifying the secondary structure of RNA in bacteria?; The two principal manners are attenuation and riboswitches.
What is attenuation and where is it commonly found?; Attenuation is the reduction of transcription through an attenuator sequence. It is commonly found in operons responsible for amino acid synthesis, such as the trp operon.
What are riboswitches and how do they regulate gene expression?; Riboswitches are conformational changes in the secondary structure of the 5' UTR or mRNA. They can be controlled by ligand-aptamer interactions and regulate transcription or translation based on the presence or absence of specific ligands.
What is the role of gene regulation in eukaryotes?; Gene regulation in eukaryotes establishes cellular heterogeneity and diversity by determining which genes are expressed and at what levels, leading to different cell identities.
What are some key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression?; Some key differences include the larger genome size and complexity in eukaryotes, the presence of histones and chromatin structure in eukaryotes, the spatial separation of transcription and translation in eukaryotes, and the use of splicing and RNA processing in eukaryotes.
What are chromatin remodelling and histone modifications?; Chromatin remodelling involves repositioning or removal of nucleosomes on DNA, while histone modifications refer to the covalent bonding of functional groups onto histone proteins. Both processes can affect the accessibility of DNA and regulate transcription.
What is DNA methylation and how does it affect gene expression?; DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl group to cytosine residues in DNA. It is associated with transcriptional silencing and can regulate gene expression by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors to DNA.
What are promoters and enhancers?; Promoters are nucleotide sequences that serve as recognition sites for the transcription machinery and are critical for transcription initiation. Enhancers are short genomic elements that regulate the transcription of regulatory elements and are important for cell type-specific gene expression.
How are enhancers and promoters brought into contact for transcriptional regulation?; Enhancers and promoters are brought into contact through looping, which allows for the stabilisation of an active transcription initiation complex.
