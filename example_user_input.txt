Regulation of gene expression Not all genes are always expressed at constant levels. The regulation of gene expression directs the production of RNA transcripts in a way that the right amount of RNA is produced at the right time in the right cells. This is crucial for proper cellular functions and enables responses to cell cycle states, environmental cues, stress, and developmental progression. In higher eukaryotes, a specific gene expression pattern is characteristic for a specific cell identity. A number of control mechanisms exist to regulate gene expression. Regulation of transcription There is a regulation of the promoter activity. These are the regulation of the activity of the transcription machinery and chromatin accessibility/epigenetic mechanisms. Posttranscriptional regulation The modification of RNA transcripts that can modulate e.g., translation efficiency or RNA stability. Specific mechanisms that result in longer or shorter mRNA half live of in differential mRNA stability. Transcriptional regulation in prokaryotes In prokaryotes transcription and translation are co-regulated, unlike in eukaryotes (separation of the nucleus-transcription, cytosol translation). Groups of genes in prokaryotes are often co-regulated in operons. Operons contain a single promoter and operator sequence and the group of genes they control. Often, multiple genes are encoded on a single polycistronic* mRNA are separated only by start and stop codons. These proteins are together required for a specific molecular process. There are 2 manners of transcriptional regulation. Positive regulation is the activation of transcription induced upon a specific signal. In all other times transcription is constitutively repressed (e.g., lac-operon). The 2nd is negative regulation. There the inactivation of transcription are once sufficient levels protein have been produced (e.g., tryptophane [trp]-operon).
